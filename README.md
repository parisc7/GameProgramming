# GameProgramming

Names: Paraskevas Costa, Jesse Andreas Christodoulou.

A mario-like game with simple mechanisms and shooting.
The player must go through some obstacles and enemies and reach to the winning line.
The Player has a Health bar with Max Health 3, and each time is collide with the enemy i loses 1/3.
When he loses the 3 lives then its game over.
Also, it has coins as collectables and each coin gives 100 points to the score, also each enemy collision detacts 100 points from the score.


WHAT WE USED IN OUR PROJECT IS:
Raycast for the shooting.
Our own script for movement, and another script for the camera.
Tilemaps and tiles to design the levels.
Enemy, rotate, restart level, level completed, Patrol and much more scripts.
We designed a health bar, with its own script.
We use collisions for the damage from enemies and collisions to collect the coins, also collision to the finish live to proceed to the next scene.
TextMeshPro texts for better design on our menus.
We have 4 scenes, Main Menu, Level01, Level02 and GameWon.
Also, we added a loading bar when you proceed from the main menu to the Level01.
We added an audio to the cameras and to the player.
We also have an options menu that you can control the master volume, we used for that a Audio mixer.
